    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is one of the most known type of dishes available in most countires
      of the world. I believe that it is incredibly hard to find a child who
      would rather not eat pizza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of this dish is somewhat interesting. My understanding is that
      it was first made as a last resource, because they used all the available
      ingredients in their home to make the first pizza. By today's standards I
      am confident that we would not even dare call that a pizza.
